WHAT IT IS
----------

gst-ducati is a plugin for using the hw accellerated codecs on IVA-HD via the
codec-engine API.  Uses the libdce (distributed codec-engine) library to
use the codec on ducati.

WHY IS IT?
----------

An OpenMAX-like API is provided by TI along with modified gst-openmax
plugins.  So gst-ducati is not needed in that sense.  But libdce and this
was an interesting project for me to try on my free time.

TODO
----
+ vp6, vp7, realvideo
+ fallbacks for sink elements not providing TILER buffers to decode into
+ search the code for XXX or TODO ;-)
